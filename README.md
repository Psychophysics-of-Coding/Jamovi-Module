This repository contains a Jamovi module designed for the analysis of psychophysiological and behavioral data collected in studies exploring the influence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and phytotherapeutics on self-efficacy and anxiety during code analysis tasks.

**Features:**

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handles importing, filtering, artifact correction, and scaling of neurophysiological data (EDA, ECG, EEG).
* **Statistical Analysis:** Performs repeated measures ANOVA to assess the effects of experimental conditions on psychophysiological measures.
* **Time-Frequency Analysis:** Conducts Fourier Transform on EEG data to analyze brainwave activity in different frequency bands.
* **Data Visualization:** Generates insightful plots, including time series plots and eye-tracking heatmaps, to visualize the data and results.
* **Integration with Questionnaires:** Supports the analysis of behavioral data from questionnaires like STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and SPSES (Self-Perceived Programming Self-Efficacy Scale).

**Jamovi Compatibility:**

* Requires Jamovi version 2.0.0 or higher.
